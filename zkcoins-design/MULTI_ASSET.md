# Multi-Asset zkCoins Design

**Status:** Design draft. No code yet. Companion to
[`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md), [`MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md`](./MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md),
and [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md). Sibling design docs:
[`BRIDGE_MVP.md`](./BRIDGE_MVP.md),
[`LIGHTNING_ATOMIC_SWAP.md`](./LIGHTNING_ATOMIC_SWAP.md),
[`BITVM_BRIDGE.md`](./BITVM_BRIDGE.md).

**Authoritative source for:** the multi-asset protocol extension —
scope, locked decisions, circuit and state-layer changes, API shape,
phased rollout, non-goals.

**Audience:** Engineers implementing the multi-asset upgrade.
Presupposes `SPEC.md` (single-asset protocol), the project
invariants in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) § "Working on
the Plonky2 Migration", and the `MAX_IN_COINS`/`MAX_OUT_COINS`
fixed-shape fanout of the current circuit.

---

## 0. Status

Design draft only. The current protocol is single-asset: `Invoice {
amount, recipient }`, `Account { balance: u64, … }`, no `asset_id`
anywhere. This document specifies the extension to a permissionless
multi-asset system — anyone mints a token by name, the creator keeps
ongoing mint authority, transactions stay single-asset, asset
metadata is name + decimals. Implementation tracking lands in
[`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) once the maintainer approves this draft.

---

## 1. Motivation

zkCoins today serves one asset: the faucet-minted unit returned by
`/api/mint`. The minting account is hard-coded (`MINTING_ADDRESS`,
see [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) §8 "Note on the minting account"), the
`Invoice` and `Coin` types carry only `amount + recipient`, and the
account-node's `balance: u64` is a single scalar.

Multi-asset opens this to any user: anyone mints a new token under a
chosen name, distributes it, and retains the right to issue more.
The shielded-CSV mechanics (per-account history SMT, global
commitment MMR, BIP-340 Schnorr inscription on Bitcoin) carry over
unchanged; the asset identity rides as an extra field on coins, on
invoices, and on the SMT-leaf pre-image.

Two design pressures pull in opposite directions:

- **Privacy** — separate per-asset anonymity pools maximise
  unlinkability across assets but multiply state and circuit cost.
- **Simplicity** — a single SMT with `asset_id` as a public field on
  each commitment keeps the circuit shape unchanged (the only new
  in-circuit constraint is "all coins in this transition share the
  same `asset_id`") and the prover cost roughly flat.

This document picks **simplicity**. The privacy trade-off is
explicit: an outside observer learns which asset moved per
transaction; the sender, recipient, and amount stay private as
before. Per-asset privacy pools are deferred (see §12.10).

The decision space matches `MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §5's pattern:
each constraint below is locked for v1 and reversible only at the
cost of a circuit redesign.

---

## 2. Decisions (locked)

The six decisions below are fixed for v1. Reversing any of them
means a non-trivial protocol-level change.

| # | Decision | Consequence |
| - | -------- | ----------- |
| **M1** | **Token creation is permissionless.** Any account can call `/api/asset/create` and mint a new asset. No whitelist, no admin gate, no fee gate. | The node is a pass-through registrar. Spam pressure is handled by the on-chain inscription fee on the genesis transaction's `Commitment`, not by the node. |
| **M2** | **Creator retains ongoing mint authority.** The asset's genesis transaction pins a `mint_authority_pubkey` (the creator's compressed secp256k1 pubkey). Subsequent `/api/mint` calls require a fresh Schnorr signature verifiable against that pubkey. No fixed-supply rule. | No "burn the key after genesis" mode. Total supply is open-ended; trust in the asset is trust in the creator not to over-issue. Key rotation is out of scope (see §11, §12.7). |
| **M3** | **Asset namespace is first-come-first-served on `name`.** The first genesis transaction binding a given `name` wins; later attempts return `409 Conflict`. Normalisation is `name.to_lowercase()` to remove the cheapest look-alike attacks; the trade-off is documented in §10. | `assets.name UNIQUE` at the SQL layer is the enforcement point. No retroactive renaming, no namespace governance. |
| **M4** | **Privacy pool is a single shared SMT.** `asset_id` is a public field on each coin commitment and a public input on each state-transition proof. Anonymity-set is per-asset (all `asset_id = X` traffic mixes; `asset_id = Y` is a separate pool). | Circuit complexity unchanged modulo one extra public input + one cross-coin equality constraint. Per-asset trees and per-asset MMRs are deferred. |
| **M5** | **Cross-asset transfers are out of protocol.** Every state transition moves exactly one `asset_id`; no atomic A↔B swap inside zkCoins. A↔B trading is a separate DEX layer (out of scope: BitVM2 bridge, Lightning atomic swap, off-protocol order-book). | The in-circuit invariant is simple: all input coins and all output coins in a transition carry the same `asset_id`. Multi-leg trades are wallet-side UX over multiple proofs, or an external swap protocol. |
| **M6** | **On-chain asset metadata is `name + decimals` only.** `name` is UTF-8, ≤ 32 bytes after normalisation; `decimals` is `u8` (0-18). No logo, URI, description, supply cap, or other fields. | Richer metadata (logo, links, social) lives off-chain — a separate registry the wallet may consult by `asset_id`. The on-chain genesis stays small and immutable; see §6.2. `decimals` is pure UX (no on-chain math change). |

These mirror the lockedness of `MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §5 (Plonky2
locked-in decisions) and `BRIDGE_MVP.md` §3 (Bridge locked technical
decisions). Each is testable at 100% coverage per invariant 4 of
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 3. Glossary additions

Extends `SPEC.md` § Glossary. Terms below are referenced throughout
this document.

| Term | Expansion | Meaning |
| ---- | --------- | ------- |
| **AssetId** | — | `HashDigest`. Deterministic Poseidon digest derived from the genesis pre-image (see §4.2). Public field on every coin commitment and every state-transition proof under the multi-asset extension. |
| **AssetGenesis** | — | The genesis transaction that creates a new asset. Carries `name`, `decimals`, `mint_authority_pubkey`, `initial_supply`, `creator_signature`. Persisted in the `assets` table; published on-chain via the same Schnorr-inscription path as a regular send. |
| **AssetMeta** | — | Off-circuit record holding `(asset_id, name, decimals, mint_authority_pubkey, creator_address, created_at)`. One row per asset in the `assets` table; never mutated after insert (immutable post-genesis). |
| **MintAuthorityKey** | — | The compressed secp256k1 pubkey pinned at genesis. Every subsequent `/api/mint` call for this asset must carry a fresh BIP-340 Schnorr signature verifiable against it. |
| **M1 – M6** | — | Locked design decisions for multi-asset (this document, §2). Mirrors `MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md`'s `D1–D11` numbering scheme. |

## 4. Protocol changes

### 4.1 Data structures

The new shape of the core types. Field additions are highlighted in
the diffs below; existing fields keep their semantics from
`SPEC.md`.

```rust
// shared/src/lib.rs

pub struct Invoice {
    pub amount:    Amount,
    pub recipient: Address,
    pub asset_id:  AssetId,        // NEW
}

// program-plonky2/src/types.rs

pub struct Coin {
    pub identifier: HashDigest,
    pub recipient:  Address,
    pub amount:     Amount,
    pub asset_id:   AssetId,       // NEW
}

pub struct CoinTemplate {
    pub recipient: Address,
    pub amount:    Amount,
    pub asset_id:  AssetId,        // NEW
}
```

`Account` (in `node/src/account_node.rs`) gains a per-asset
balance map; the old `balance: u64` collapses to "balance of the
default asset" only for the migration window (see §6.3 — there is
no migration window because state is wiped at cutover, so the field
is replaced outright).

```rust
// node/src/account_node.rs

pub struct Account {
    pub proof:        Option<Proof>,
    pub coin_queue:   Vec<CoinProof>,
    pub coin_history: SparseMerkleTree,
    pub balances:     BTreeMap<AssetId, u64>,   // REPLACES `balance: u64`
}
```

New record type for the asset registry:

```rust
// shared/src/lib.rs

pub struct AssetMeta {
    pub asset_id:              AssetId,
    pub name:                  String,                 // normalised, ≤ 32 bytes UTF-8
    pub decimals:              u8,                     // 0-18
    pub mint_authority_pubkey: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    pub creator_address:       Address,
    pub created_at:            u64,                    // unix seconds
    pub initial_supply:        u64,
}
```

The Plonky2 `AccountState` carried inside the circuit — see
`program-plonky2/src/types.rs::AccountState` — stays single-balance
per-proof: each state-transition proof concerns exactly one
`asset_id` (decision **M5**), so `AccountState.balance` is the
balance of *that* asset for the duration of *this* proof. The
per-asset book-keeping for an account lives off-circuit in
`Account.balances`; the prover witnesses only the balance for the
asset being moved.

This keeps the in-circuit `AccountState` layout (`[owner_limbs(4),
balance_lo, balance_hi, pubkey_x_limbs(4), pubkey_parity]` — see
`SPEC.md` §12.3) almost unchanged. The minimal addition is one new
public input: `asset_id` (4 field elements).

### 4.2 Asset genesis (creation)

An asset genesis is a state-transition proof of a new variant —
call it `AssetGenesisProof` — that mints `initial_supply` units to
the creator's account, binds the asset's `name`, `decimals`, and
`mint_authority_pubkey` into the asset registry, and publishes the
same Schnorr-signed `Commitment` as a regular send.

`AssetId` derivation:

```
asset_id := Poseidon(
    DOMAIN_TAG_ASSET_GENESIS,
    creator_pubkey_limbs(5),
    name_limbs(N),
    decimals,
    timestamp,
)
```

`DOMAIN_TAG_ASSET_GENESIS` is a fixed Goldilocks field element
constant (e.g. `hash_bytes(b"zkcoins:asset-genesis:v1")` taken as a
field element). `timestamp` is the genesis request's unix-seconds
value, included so the AssetId is content-addressed: two creators
who pick the same `(creator_pubkey, name, decimals)` (e.g. on a
state-wiped DEV that allows name reuse, or after a future asset
deletion mechanism) still get distinct `asset_id`s. Note that
`assets.name UNIQUE` already prevents production name collisions
on a single instance — the timestamp is belt-and-braces, plus a
provenance marker for off-chain registries. See §12.1 for the
open question on whether to drop it.

The genesis carries five things into the world:

1. **`name`** — normalised (`to_lowercase()`, validated UTF-8, ≤ 32
   bytes after normalisation). Uniqueness is enforced at the SQL
   layer via the `assets.name UNIQUE` constraint (§6.2). The first
   genesis to commit wins; concurrent attempts return `409
   Conflict` (§10).
2. **`decimals`** — `u8`, 0-18. UX-only; no on-chain math depends on
   it.
3. **`mint_authority_pubkey`** — compressed secp256k1, pinned for
   the life of the asset.
4. **`initial_supply`** — `u64`, minted to the creator's address at
   genesis. May be 0 (the creator can choose to mint later via
   `/api/mint`).
5. **`creator_signature`** — BIP-340 Schnorr over
   `H("zkcoins:asset-genesis" || asset_id || initial_supply_le ||
   timestamp_le)`, verifiable against `mint_authority_pubkey`. This
   binds the genesis transaction to the same key that will sign
   future mints, preventing a separate party from claiming the
   asset's name.

### 4.3 Mint (subsequent issuance)

After genesis, the asset creator may issue further units by calling
`/api/mint { asset_id, recipient, amount, signature, timestamp }`.
The node:

1. Looks up `AssetMeta` by `asset_id`. Rejects if unknown.
2. Verifies the BIP-340 Schnorr signature over
   `H("zkcoins:mint" || asset_id || recipient || amount_le ||
   timestamp_le)` against the asset's stored
   `mint_authority_pubkey`.
3. Rejects if the timestamp is older than 300 s or in the future —
   matches the existing replay window in
   `verify_send_signature` (`node/src/router.rs`).
4. Runs the prover to produce a state-transition proof that moves
   `amount` units of `asset_id` from the asset's mint-authority
   account into a fresh coin for `recipient`. The same circuit
   shape as a normal send; the only branch difference is that the
   in-circuit signature gate fires against `mint_authority_pubkey`
   instead of the sender's commitment pubkey (see §5).

The current `/api/mint` is permissioned only by the node's
faucet config (`feature = "faucet"`, `MINTING_ADDRESS` hard-coded);
under multi-asset it becomes a signed request from any creator for
their own asset.

### 4.4 Send

`/api/send` keeps its current shape, with `asset_id` added to the
`Invoice` and the existing Schnorr signature widened to cover it
under a new domain-prefix tag:

```
H("zkcoins:send"
  || account_address
  || recipient
  || amount_le
  || asset_id
  || timestamp_le)
```

Existing wallets sign over `SHA256(account_address || recipient
|| amount_le || timestamp_le)` with **no** domain prefix — see
`verify_send_signature` in `node/src/router.rs`. The multi-asset
upgrade does two things to this hash:

1. **Adds `asset_id`** between `amount_le` and `timestamp_le`.
   This is the necessary part — the signature must commit to
   which asset is moving.
2. **Prepends `"zkcoins:send"`** as a domain-separation tag.
   This is a deliberate defense-in-depth addition, not a passive
   widening: it future-proofs against a `/api/mint` or
   `/api/asset/create` message hash being reused as a send
   signature once those endpoints share the same secp256k1 key
   material (the wallet's account key signs both). The mint and
   genesis hashes already carry their own `"zkcoins:mint"` and
   `"zkcoins:asset-genesis"` prefixes (§4.2, §4.3); adding
   `"zkcoins:send"` here normalises the convention across all
   three message types. See §12.5 for the open question on
   whether the prefix is strictly required given invariant 2.

Both changes are breaking for the wallet signature shape; bump
`Capabilities.multi_asset` (§7) so wallets know to include them.

**Single-asset invariant.** In a single transition, all input coins
and all output coins share the same `asset_id`. This is enforced
twice — defense in depth, matching the pattern in
`node/src/account_node.rs::send_coins` (off-circuit pre-check)
and `program-plonky2/src/circuit/main.rs` (in-circuit constraint):

- **Off-circuit (node pre-check):** before paying prove cost,
  iterate `account.coin_queue` and `invoices`, assert every
  `asset_id` equals the transition's claimed `asset_id`. Reject
  with `400 Mixed assets in single transition` on mismatch.
- **In-circuit (ZK constraint):** see §5.2.

### 4.5 Balance

`/api/balance` returns a map of `{ asset_id_hex: amount }` instead
of a single `balance: u64`. Single-asset clients see a one-entry
map under the well-known "default" asset id; multi-asset clients
iterate.

```json
{
  "address": "ab12…",
  "balances": [
    { "asset_id": "00112233…", "amount": 42 },
    { "asset_id": "deadbeef…", "amount": 1000 }
  ]
}
```

Because the response shape changes, bump
`Capabilities.multi_asset = true` so single-asset clients can fall
back gracefully. See §7 for the full API delta.

---

## 5. ZK-circuit changes (Plonky2)

The state-transition circuit lives in
`program-plonky2/src/circuit/main.rs`. The multi-asset extension is
additive: one new public input, one new cross-coin equality
constraint per active in-coin and out-coin slot, no shape change to
the cyclic-recursion plumbing.

### 5.1 New public input

`ProofData` gains an `asset_id` field. Public-input layout becomes:

| slot range | meaning                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 0..4       | account_state_hash       |
| 4..8       | output_coins_root        |
| 8..12      | commitment_history_root  |
| 12..16     | coin_history_root        |
| **16..20** | **asset_id (new)**       |

`N_PROOF_DATA_PUBLIC_INPUTS` increases from 16 to 20. Knock-on
effects:

- `ProofData::to_field_elements` (`program-plonky2/src/types.rs`)
  and `ProofData::from_field_elements` extend by one
  `HashDigest`.
- `state_transition_num_pis()` in `circuit/main.rs` recomputes
  to `20 + 4 + 4 * cap_elements`.
- The cyclic-recursion `common_data_for_recursion_c_inner` rebuild
  picks up the new PI count automatically once
  `N_PROOF_DATA_PUBLIC_INPUTS` is bumped; no manual padding tweak
  required, but the `INNER_PAD_BITS_STAGE_5D_NEXT_5` constant
  should be re-verified by `recursion_shape_probe::dump_*` per the
  procedure in `MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §7.22 to confirm the
  helper-degree → outer-degree match still holds at the new PI
  count.

### 5.2 New in-circuit constraints

The single-asset invariant (M5) is enforced as a fan-in equality
gate: every active in-coin slot's `coin.asset_id` and every active
out-coin slot's `out_coin.asset_id` is connected to the
transition's `asset_id` public input. Inactive slots are masked by
their `active` bit, identical to the existing balance / recipient
gates in `program-plonky2/src/circuit/main.rs`.

```rust
// Pseudo-code, fits next to the existing per-slot recipient + amount checks
// in the in-coin and out-coin loops in circuit/main.rs.

for slot in in_coin_slots {
    // Existing: `slot.active * (slot.recipient - account.owner) == 0`
    // New:
    //     `slot.active * (slot.asset_id - transition_asset_id) == 0`
    connect_hashes_masked(&mut builder, slot.active, slot.asset_id, transition_asset_id);
}

for slot in out_coin_slots {
    connect_hashes_masked(&mut builder, slot.active, slot.asset_id, transition_asset_id);
}
```

Coin identifier derivation (`calculate_coin_identifier` in
`program-plonky2/src/types.rs`) extends to include `asset_id` so
that the same recipient/amount pair on two different assets
produces distinct identifiers:

```
identifier := Poseidon(account_state_hash, asset_id, u32(coin_index))
```

The SMT leaf pre-image for the coin-history SMT
(`SparseMerkleTree::insert(key, value)` keyed by
`coin.identifier`) automatically inherits the new identifier
shape; no SMT-layer change is required.

### 5.3 Mint-branch signature constraint

The current circuit handles the faucet mint via the
`MINTING_ADDRESS` exception (`SPEC.md` §8 "Note on the minting
account"). Under multi-asset this generalises: the genesis and the
ongoing mint paths take the `AssetGenesisProof` /
`AssetMintProof` branches in `ProofType`, and the in-circuit
constraint becomes "the request is signed by the asset's
`mint_authority_pubkey`".

Two viable architectures, mirroring the recurring trade-off in
`SPEC.md` §12.6:

1. **Off-circuit Schnorr verify (preferred for v1).** The node
   verifies the BIP-340 Schnorr signature with the existing
   `secp.verify_schnorr` call (the same path used by
   `verify_send_signature` in `node/src/router.rs`), and the
   in-circuit branch only enforces that the proof's
   `mint_authority_pubkey` public input matches the
   asset-registry-stored value. The asset registry is node state,
   not on-chain state — the mainnet hardening track decides whether
   this is acceptable (it is for the closed test environment per
   invariant 2 of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)).
2. **In-circuit Schnorr verify.** Add a BIP-340 Schnorr gadget to
   the circuit, witness the signature, and verify in-circuit. More
   expensive (Schnorr-on-secp256k1 inside Plonky2 is non-trivial
   — see `MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §5.4) and not required for the
   trust model decided in M1 + M2.

→ **v1: option 1.** The mint-authority pubkey is a regular
  public-input on the genesis/mint branches; the signature check is
  off-circuit. The architectural call is open at §12.6 — flip to
  in-circuit if a future deployment requires the stronger trust
  model.

### 5.4 Prover cost delta

The per-tx cost delta is **minor**:

- +4 public inputs (one new `HashDigest` worth) per proof.
- +4 × (`MAX_IN_COINS` + `MAX_OUT_COINS`) = +64 masked-equality
  field-element constraints per proof. Each `connect_hashes_masked`
  on a `HashOut<F>` (4 elements per Plonky2
  `NUM_HASH_OUT_ELTS`) lands four masked-equality gates; with
  `MAX_IN_COINS = MAX_OUT_COINS = 8` per
  `program-plonky2/src/circuit/main.rs`, that is 16 slots × 4 =
  64 gates total — negligible against the ~50 k-gate outer
  circuit (`INNER_PAD_BITS_STAGE_5D_NEXT_5 = 15`).
- One extra `HashOut<F>` (4 field elements) added to the
  coin-identifier pre-image (was `(asth_4, coin_index_1)` = 5
  elements; now `(asth_4, asset_id_4, coin_index_1)` = 9
  elements). Plonky2 Goldilocks Poseidon has `SPONGE_RATE = 8`
  (`plonky2::hash::poseidon::SPONGE_RATE`), so 5 elements
  absorbed in one permutation; 9 elements now absorb in two. The
  per-coin Poseidon cost roughly doubles for the identifier
  derivation, but this is one extra permutation per slot —
  negligible against the per-slot work elsewhere in the circuit.

The R2 performance budget from `CONTRIBUTING.md` invariant 3 (warm
≤ 5 s, ≤ 64 GB peak) is not threatened by multi-asset alone.

### 5.5 Cite-points

For implementers, the relevant code sites in the current circuit:

- Public-input count: `program-plonky2/src/circuit/main.rs::N_PROOF_DATA_PUBLIC_INPUTS`.
- Per-slot in-coin processing (where the new `asset_id` equality
  gate lands): the in-coin loop in `build_circuit`.
- Per-slot out-coin processing: the out-coin loop in
  `build_circuit`, alongside the existing identifier-check.
- Coin-identifier derivation: `program-plonky2/src/types.rs::calculate_coin_identifier`.
- Padding constants: `INNER_PAD_BITS_STAGE_5D_NEXT_5`,
  re-verified via `recursion_shape_probe::dump_phase_2a_pad_bits_sweep`.

## 6. State layer

### 6.1 SMT changes

Coin commitments include `asset_id` in the pre-image via the new
`calculate_coin_identifier` formula (§5.2). The SMT structure stays
single-tree per **M4**; `asset_id` is just one more field in the
leaf pre-image, so the existing `program-plonky2/src/merkle/sparse_merkle_tree.rs`
needs no structural change. The global commitment-history SMT and
MMR (see `SPEC.md` §5) keep their current shape — they are keyed by
the commitment pubkey, not by `asset_id`, so cross-asset proofs
share the same history root and the same anonymity-set at the
commitment layer.

### 6.2 Postgres schema deltas

New table `assets` — one row per registered asset, immutable
post-insert:

```sql
CREATE TABLE assets (
    asset_id              BYTEA       PRIMARY KEY,
    name                  TEXT        NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    decimals              SMALLINT    NOT NULL,
    mint_authority_pubkey BYTEA       NOT NULL,
    creator_address       BYTEA       NOT NULL,
    initial_supply        BIGINT      NOT NULL,
    created_at            TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX assets_name_idx ON assets (name);
```

The `name UNIQUE` constraint is the first-come-first-served
enforcement point (decision M3 / §10).

The `accounts` row needs to hold a per-asset balance. Two options
match the trade-off space of `SPEC.md` §12.8 and `MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md`
§5: simpler vs. more queryable.

**Option (a) — JSONB column on `accounts`:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN balances JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}';
-- Shape: { "<asset_id_hex>": <u64-as-string-or-number>, ... }
```

**Option (b) — separate `account_balances` table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE account_balances (
    address   BYTEA NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(address) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    asset_id  BYTEA NOT NULL REFERENCES assets(asset_id),
    amount    BIGINT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (address, asset_id)
);
```

→ **v1: option (a).** The bincode-`Account`-in-`BYTEA` pattern
already used for the `accounts` table (see
`CONTRIBUTING.md` § "Persistent State") composes naturally with a
`BTreeMap<AssetId, u64>` field on `Account`; the JSONB column is a
side index for ad-hoc queries (`SELECT … WHERE balances ?
'<asset_id_hex>'` works in Postgres). If the operational team later
needs richer balance queries (top-holders, distribution histograms),
add option (b) as a derived table populated by a trigger; not
needed for the MVP.

The `minting_meta.num_pubkeys` counter that the faucet uses
(`CONTRIBUTING.md` § "Persistent State") becomes per-asset.
Simplest shape: fold it into `assets` as a `num_pubkeys BIGINT NOT
NULL DEFAULT 0` column, advanced atomically per mint.

```sql
ALTER TABLE assets ADD COLUMN num_pubkeys BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

The standalone `minting_meta` row is dropped at cutover (no
migration window, see §6.3).

### 6.3 Migration notes

Per [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) invariant 2 ("Closed
test environment — DEV *and* PRD"), the cutover wipes node state
and starts fresh. No live-migration logic.

The recovery procedure from `CONTRIBUTING.md` § "DEV state
recovery" applies as written: stop the node, truncate every
state-layer table (now including `assets`), drop the proofs
directory, restart. The pre-multi-asset coins are abandoned on-chain
(they're random test data); the new node starts at genesis with
an empty `assets` table.

PR-A1/A2/A3 already left DEV and PRD with empty Postgres state
after the Plonky2 cutover (`SPEC.md` invariant 2; PR
[#73](https://github.com/zk-coins/node/pull/73) finalised the
state-wipe pattern). Multi-asset reuses the same operational
procedure; no new wipe tooling required.

## 7. API changes

For each endpoint, the new shape and back-compat note.

### 7.1 `POST /api/asset/create` (new)

Genesis a new asset.

```
Body:
{
  "name":                  "FOO",
  "decimals":              8,
  "initial_supply":        1000000,
  "mint_authority_pubkey": "<33-byte hex>",
  "signature":             "<64-byte BIP-340 Schnorr hex>",
  "timestamp":             1716393600
}

Response (201 Created):
{
  "asset_id": "<32-byte hex>",
  "name":     "foo"
}

Response (409 Conflict):
{ "error": "asset name already taken" }
```

The handler:

1. Normalises `name` (`to_lowercase()`, UTF-8-validate, byte-length
   check ≤ 32).
2. Validates `decimals ∈ [0, 18]`.
3. Verifies the BIP-340 Schnorr signature against
   `mint_authority_pubkey` over
   `H("zkcoins:asset-genesis" || name_normalised || decimals ||
   initial_supply_le || timestamp_le)`.
4. Computes `asset_id` per §4.2.
5. Begins a transaction: `INSERT INTO assets … ON CONFLICT (name)
   DO NOTHING`. If the insert affected zero rows, the name was
   already taken — return 409. Otherwise, run the prover to
   produce the `AssetGenesisProof`, persist the proof file, and
   advance the SMT. This matches the existing
   `UsernameStore::claim` pattern in `node/src/username.rs`
   (`ON CONFLICT (username) DO NOTHING` + post-check on the
   returned row count).
6. Returns `{ asset_id, name }`.

Suggested handler name: `asset_create_handler`. Suggested request
type: `AssetCreateRequest`.

### 7.2 `GET /api/asset/list` (new)

List every known asset.

```
Response:
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "asset_id":              "<hex>",
      "name":                  "foo",
      "decimals":              8,
      "mint_authority_pubkey": "<33-byte hex>",
      "creator_address":       "<32-byte hex>",
      "initial_supply":        1000000,
      "num_pubkeys":           42,
      "created_at":            "2026-05-22T12:00:00Z"
    },
    …
  ]
}
```

Suggested handler name: `asset_list_handler`. Read-only; serves
straight from the `assets` table; cache headers per the existing
`/api/info` pattern.

### 7.3 `GET /api/asset/info/:id_or_name` (new)

Single-asset lookup. Path parameter is either the lowercased name
or the hex-encoded `asset_id`. Returns one of the records from
`/api/asset/list`'s `assets` array, or `404 Not Found`.

Suggested handler name: `asset_info_handler`.

### 7.4 `POST /api/mint` (modified)

The current faucet semantics
(`feature = "faucet"`, no signature required because the node is
the minter) are removed. The new shape:

```
Body:
{
  "asset_id":  "<hex>",
  "recipient": "<address hex>",
  "amount":    100,
  "signature": "<BIP-340 Schnorr hex>",
  "timestamp": 1716393600
}
```

Handler verifies the signature against the asset's stored
`mint_authority_pubkey` (§4.3). The faucet shortcut survives only
as the "creator never signed away the key, so they can call this"
case — it is no longer privileged.

`feature = "faucet"` is collapsed into the always-on path; the
`Capabilities.faucet` flag stays for back-compat but is wired to
`multi_asset` truthiness (see §7.8).

### 7.5 `POST /api/send` (modified)

Adds `asset_id` to the request body:

```
Body:
{
  "account_address": "<hex>",
  "recipient":       "<hex>",
  "amount":          100,
  "asset_id":        "<hex>",         // NEW
  "public_key":      "<33-byte hex>",
  "signature":       "<BIP-340 Schnorr hex>",
  "timestamp":       1716393600
}
```

The Schnorr-signed message extends to cover `asset_id` (see §4.4).
Existing single-asset wallets break here unless they update to the
new signature shape — gated by `Capabilities.multi_asset`.

### 7.6 `GET /api/balance` (modified — breaking)

Was:

```json
{ "balance": 1234, "username": "alice" }
```

Becomes:

```json
{
  "balances": [
    { "asset_id": "<hex>", "amount": 1234 }
  ],
  "username": "alice"
}
```

This is a breaking change for single-asset wallets. They MUST gate
on `Capabilities.multi_asset` and switch parser. There is no
back-compat shim — the migration is at cutover, the closed
environment makes it safe (invariant 2).

### 7.7 `POST /api/commit` (unchanged)

Shape unchanged. The underlying proof carries `asset_id` because
it is now part of `ProofData`, but the commit endpoint's wire
shape (proof_id + Schnorr commitment) does not.

### 7.8 `GET /api/info` (modified)

`Capabilities` gains `multi_asset`:

```rust
pub struct Capabilities {
    pub address_list: bool,
    pub faucet:       bool,
    pub usernames:    bool,
    pub lnurl:        bool,
    pub multi_asset:  bool,        // NEW
}
```

The `faucet` flag stays for wallet-side back-compat (it has been
`false` since PR [#73](https://github.com/zk-coins/node/pull/73)
on both DEV and PRD anyway) but is functionally subsumed by
`multi_asset = true` once the upgrade lands.

---

## 8. Wallet (client) impact

This document is node-centric. The wallet (`zk-coins/app`)
adapts in four places; full design is out of scope here.

- **Per-asset balance display.** The wallet's home screen renders a
  list of `(asset_meta, amount)` rather than a single balance.
  Drives a `/api/asset/list` fetch on first open and on background
  refresh; `asset_id → AssetMeta` lookup is cached.
- **Asset selection in the send flow.** The send screen gains an
  asset picker. The wallet's existing single-asset send becomes
  "send the default asset"; the new send-flow is "pick asset,
  enter amount, recipient".
- **Create-asset UX.** New screen: name, decimals, initial supply.
  Signs the genesis request with the wallet's existing key
  derivation tree — `mint_authority_pubkey` is the wallet's
  account pubkey, no new key material required.
- **Schnorr signature scope.** The same BIP-340 key signs over the
  extended message (now including `asset_id`); no key-management
  changes.

The current Schnorr-derivation pattern (BIP-32 child key per
commitment, derivation index = `num_pubkeys - 1`) carries over
without modification. `asset_id` is an extra field hashed into the
signed message, not a separate keyspace.

---

## 9. Privacy properties

The trade-off picked by M4 is explicit: per-transaction privacy
narrows from "anyone on the protocol" to "anyone on this asset".

| Observer learns | From | When |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Transaction exists | On-chain `4242`-prefix inscription | Real-time |
| `asset_id` of the transaction | Public input of the proof, included in `ProofData` and the inscription's commitment message | Real-time |
| Transaction count per asset | Aggregate scanner data | Real-time |
| Total on-chain throughput per asset | Aggregate scanner data | Real-time |

| Observer does **not** learn | Why |
| --------------------------- | --- |
| Sender address | Shielded by the SMT/MMR structure (`SPEC.md` §5) |
| Recipient address | Same |
| Amount | Same |
| Cross-asset linkage | Each transition concerns exactly one asset (M5); the wallet does not bundle transactions across assets |

**Anonymity set:** per asset. All transfers of asset X mix
together; transfers of asset Y are a separate pool because
`asset_id` is public on the commitment. A new asset with low
volume has a small anonymity set on day one and grows with
adoption; this is the privacy/simplicity trade-off the design
accepts under M4.

**Mitigation paths (out of scope for v1):**

- Per-asset privacy pools with a per-asset SMT and a per-asset
  MMR. Multiplies state cost by `n_assets`; deferred (§12.10).
- Hide `asset_id` behind a commitment (Pedersen `Commitment::commit(asset_id, rand)`)
  in the on-chain inscription. Closes the "asset_id is public"
  leak at the cost of a `Commitment::commit` opening in every
  recipient's proof — same shape as the D2/D10 hiding-recipient
  fix in `SPEC.md` §15. Tracked in §12.11.

The two mitigations compose; they are tracked together in §12.10
and §12.11.

---

## 10. First-come-first-served namespace enforcement

The mechanics behind decision M3.

- **SQL enforcement.** `assets.name UNIQUE` + `INSERT … ON CONFLICT
  (name) DO NOTHING` — the same pattern as the username store
  (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` § "Persistent State" `usernames` row).
  Whichever genesis transaction commits first wins. Concurrent
  attempts on the same name receive `409 Conflict`.
- **No retroactive renaming.** Once `assets.name` is set, it is
  immutable. The `assets` row is never `UPDATE`d after insert;
  there is no admin endpoint to rename.
- **Case-insensitive normalisation.** `name.to_lowercase()` (Rust
  default, locale-independent Unicode lowercasing) is applied at
  validation time and at lookup time. This removes the cheapest
  homograph class (`USDT` vs `usdt` vs `Usdt`) at the cost of
  ruling out distinct names that differ only in case.
- **Trade-off acknowledged.** Full homograph defence
  (`u` vs Cyrillic `u`, zero-width-joiner attacks) is out of scope
  for v1. The same trade-off applies as in `feedback_dns_migration`
  — every name shown in the wallet UI MUST be displayed with both
  `name` and `asset_id` (the asset_id is the trust anchor; the
  name is UX). Wallets that show only `name` carry the homograph
  risk.

Race-handling at the database layer is the canonical solution; do
not rely on application-side locking. Postgres' MVCC guarantees
that exactly one writer wins the unique-key race; the others'
`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING` returns zero affected
rows, which the handler translates to HTTP 409. This avoids the
need to catch and re-classify a `23505 unique_violation` —
matches `db::claim_username` in `node/src/db.rs`.

---

## 11. Mint authority

The mechanics behind decision M2.

- **Genesis pins `mint_authority_pubkey`.** Compressed secp256k1,
  written into the `assets` row at creation, immutable thereafter.
- **Subsequent mint signature.** Every `/api/mint` request carries
  a BIP-340 Schnorr signature over
  `SHA256("zkcoins:mint" || asset_id || recipient || amount_le ||
  timestamp_le)`, verified against the asset's
  `mint_authority_pubkey`. Same secp256k1 primitive as the send
  signature (`verify_send_signature` in `node/src/router.rs`); no
  new crypto primitive.
- **Replay protection.** 5-minute timestamp window
  (`now.abs_diff(timestamp) > 300 → reject`), matching the
  existing pattern.
- **Per-asset request counter.** The `assets.num_pubkeys` column
  advances per mint (§6.2). The minting account's
  `prev_commitment_pubkey` is derived from this counter exactly as
  the existing faucet's `minting_meta.num_pubkeys` does today.
- **No fixed supply.** The protocol does not enforce a hard cap.
  Total supply is `initial_supply + Σ(mint amounts)`. Off-chain
  registries may publish supply caps as a social convention; the
  protocol does not.
- **Key rotation is out of scope.** A creator who loses their
  mint-authority key loses the ability to mint more units. There
  is no admin override, no rotation endpoint, no escape hatch.
  Future work — see §12.7.

## 12. Open questions / future work

Three groups: open architectural questions the maintainer needs
to rule on before P2 starts (§12.1 – §12.6), deferred features
the design explicitly punts on (§12.7 – §12.12), and one
semantic clarification (§12.13). Bullets follow the shape of
`BRIDGE_MVP.md` §13.

### 12.1 AssetId pre-image: keep `timestamp` or drop it?

§4.2 includes `timestamp` in the Poseidon pre-image alongside
`creator_pubkey`, `name`, and `decimals`. The `assets.name UNIQUE`
constraint (M3 / §10) already enforces first-come-first-served
name uniqueness at the SQL layer, so `timestamp` is not load-
bearing for collision resistance on a single instance.

- **Choice in doc:** include `timestamp`. Acts as a provenance
  marker (off-chain registries learn when the asset was created
  by inspecting the AssetId) and lets the same `(pubkey, name,
  decimals)` tuple produce distinct AssetIds across state-wiped
  test environments.
- **Alternative:** drop `timestamp`. AssetId becomes a pure
  function of `(creator_pubkey, name, decimals)`; reproducible
  across environments; smaller pre-image.
- **Trade-off:** keeping it costs nothing on-chain (one extra
  field element in a Poseidon pre-image, already covered by §5.4)
  and gives a free provenance hint. Dropping it makes AssetIds
  reproducible across DEV/PRD, which simplifies cross-environment
  testing but means a wiped DEV that re-creates `("FOO", 8)` from
  the same creator collides with the old AssetId — fine in
  practice (state is wiped together) but worth a maintainer call.

### 12.2 Postgres balance shape: JSONB column vs separate table?

§6.2 picks **option (a) — JSONB column on `accounts`**. The
trade-off is real and the maintainer may prefer (b).

- **Choice in doc:** JSONB column. Composes naturally with the
  existing `bincode-Account-in-BYTEA` pattern; the JSONB is a
  side index for `WHERE balances ? '<asset_id_hex>'` queries.
- **Alternative:** separate `account_balances` table keyed by
  `(address, asset_id)` with a `BIGINT amount` column. Cleaner
  for Postgres-side queries (top-holders, distribution
  histograms, `SUM(amount) WHERE asset_id = X` for total
  supply audits).
- **Trade-off:** JSONB minimises moving parts but pushes
  query complexity into application code. The separate table
  multiplies writes per state transition (one row per affected
  asset per account) but makes operational queries trivial. If
  the maintainer expects significant on-Postgres analytics
  tooling, switch to (b) before P3 lands.

### 12.3 Wallet rollout coordination for the breaking `/api/balance` shape

§7.6 changes `/api/balance` from `{ balance: u64 }` to `{
balances: [{ asset_id, amount }] }`. This is the single
client-visible breaking change in the upgrade.

- **Choice in doc:** gate purely on `Capabilities.multi_asset =
  true` from `/api/info`. Wallets check the capability flag on
  every boot and switch their parser accordingly.
- **Alternative:** add a `version: u32` field to
  `/api/balance`'s response (and to `/api/info`'s `Capabilities`)
  so wallets can detect the schema bump even if they fail to
  re-fetch `/api/info` first. Or: ship both shapes for a
  cutover window (`balances` and `balance` both populated for
  N days).
- **Trade-off:** invariant 2 (closed test environment, DEV and
  PRD) makes the capability-flag approach safe — there are no
  external wallets to worry about, and the wallet
  (zk-coins/app) and node roll out together in lockstep.
  Adding a version field is belt-and-braces that costs nothing
  but pollutes the JSON. Recommend keeping capability-flag only
  unless the maintainer wants the safety net.

### 12.4 Unicode homograph defence beyond `to_lowercase()`?

§10 picks case-insensitive normalisation via `name.to_lowercase()`.
This defends `USDT` / `Usdt` / `usdt` but not Cyrillic-А (U+0410)
vs Latin-A (U+0041), zero-width-joiner attacks, or other Unicode
confusables.

- **Choice in doc:** Rust's locale-independent `to_lowercase()`
  only. Wallet UI is expected to display both `name` and
  `asset_id` so the AssetId is the trust anchor.
- **Alternative:** NFKC normalisation + a Unicode confusables
  filter (e.g. `unicode-security` crate's `mixed_script_confusable`
  detection) at the validation stage. Rejects names whose
  script mix is suspicious; closes the most common phishing
  vectors at registry-write time.
- **Trade-off:** `to_lowercase()` alone is cheap and reversible
  but trusts the wallet UX to enforce the rest. NFKC +
  confusables is the right long-term answer but adds a
  dependency and rejects some legitimate names (mixed-script
  brand names). The current design takes the cheap path and
  treats the AssetId as the trust anchor; if mainnet hardening
  ever lands, revisit at the namespace-governance step.

### 12.5 `"zkcoins:send"` domain-tag: keep, drop, or version?

§4.4 introduces a `"zkcoins:send"` domain-separation prefix on
the send-signature hash. Current `verify_send_signature` signs
without a prefix.

- **Choice in doc:** add the prefix as defense-in-depth, mirroring
  the `"zkcoins:mint"` and `"zkcoins:asset-genesis"` prefixes
  on the other two message types.
- **Alternative:** keep the unprefixed shape and only add
  `asset_id` to the existing fields. Simpler diff against the
  current `verify_send_signature`; one fewer thing for the
  wallet to update.
- **Trade-off:** the prefix prevents future cross-message
  signature reuse (e.g. a malicious peer convincing a wallet to
  sign what looks like a send but is actually a mint over the
  same key material). Under invariant 2 (closed environment),
  the attack surface is low — but the prefix is free at
  signing time and the wallet update is a single hashing tweak
  bundled with the `asset_id` widening. Recommend keeping
  unless the maintainer objects to the broader signature
  shape change.

### 12.6 Off-circuit vs in-circuit Schnorr for the mint branch

§5.3 picks off-circuit Schnorr verify for the mint and genesis
branches. The asset registry is node state, not on-chain state.

- **Choice in doc:** off-circuit verify via existing
  `secp.verify_schnorr`. The in-circuit branch only enforces
  that the proof's `mint_authority_pubkey` matches the
  registry value.
- **Alternative:** in-circuit BIP-340 Schnorr-on-secp256k1
  gadget. Verifies the mint signature inside the proof itself;
  removes the node-state trust assumption.
- **Trade-off:** in-circuit Schnorr-on-secp256k1 is non-trivial
  in Plonky2 (`MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §5.4 has the analysis).
  For the closed test environment (invariant 2), off-circuit
  is sufficient. If a future deployment treats minting as a
  bridge primitive or moves to a trust-minimised setting, this
  decision flips and the gadget cost lands in the prover
  budget.

### 12.7 Key rotation for mint authority (deferred feature)

If a creator loses their signing key (or wants to migrate to a
new one), the asset is effectively frozen at its current supply.
A rotation mechanism — signed by the old key, written as an
`assets.rotation_pubkey` column — is the obvious extension. Out
of scope for v1 to keep the genesis path immutable; revisit
once a real key-loss event lands.

### 12.8 Richer on-chain metadata (deferred feature)

Logos, URIs, descriptions, social links. M6 explicitly excludes
these — they live in an off-chain registry the wallet consults
by `asset_id`. The on-chain genesis stays small.

### 12.9 Cross-asset atomic swap inside zkCoins (deferred feature)

M5 defers this. Trading happens on a separate DEX layer; the
BitVM2 bridge (`BRIDGE_MVP.md`) and the Lightning atomic swap
layer (`LIGHTNING_ATOMIC_SWAP.md`) are the canonical
out-of-protocol paths.

### 12.10 Per-asset privacy pools (deferred feature)

M4 picks the shared-pool design for simplicity. A per-asset
SMT + per-asset MMR raises anonymity-set per asset to "the
asset's own traffic, hidden from other assets' traffic" — same
as Tornado-style pool separation. Cost: multiplies state and
Bitcoin-side commitment traffic by `n_assets`. Deferred.

### 12.11 Hiding `asset_id` on-chain (deferred feature)

Combines with the D2/D10 hiding-recipient fix in `SPEC.md` §15.
Out of scope for v1; tracked alongside the mainnet-blocker
privacy fixes. Closes the "asset_id is public on every
commitment" leak at the cost of a `Commitment::commit` opening
in every recipient's proof.

### 12.12 Burn (asset deflation) (deferred feature)

Not in MVP. If a future creator wants explicit burn, the
cleanest design is a sentinel recipient address (`BURN_ADDRESS
= HashDigest::ZERO` or a domain-separated constant) that the
circuit treats as a coin sink with no corresponding
`apply_coin`. Adds one branch in
`account_node::receive_coin`. Defer until a real use case
arrives.

### 12.13 Decimals semantics (clarification)

Purely UX-display. The on-chain `amount` is a `u64`; the
wallet formats with `decimals` for display only. No on-chain
math change. The protocol does not enforce that `amount %
10**decimals` makes sense.

---

## 13. Implementation order

Phased rollout, mapped to PR boundaries. Effort estimates are
qualitative (S = small, M = medium, L = large, XL = extra large)
per the convention in `BRIDGE_MVP.md` §12.1.

| Phase | Scope | Effort | Risk |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
| **P1 — Shared types + AssetId plumbing** | `shared/src/lib.rs` gains `AssetId`, `AssetMeta`; `Invoice` gains `asset_id`; `program-plonky2/src/types.rs::Coin`/`CoinTemplate` gain `asset_id`. No behaviour change yet — the field is propagated but the node defaults it to a placeholder `DEFAULT_ASSET_ID` so existing tests pass unchanged. Drop in a `MULTI_ASSET_FIXME` comment at every site that will need real handling in P5. | **S** | Low — mechanical |
| **P2 — Circuit extension** | `program-plonky2/src/circuit/main.rs`: bump `N_PROOF_DATA_PUBLIC_INPUTS` to 20, add `asset_id` public input, add per-slot masked-equality gates, extend `calculate_coin_identifier`. Re-run `recursion_shape_probe::dump_phase_2a_pad_bits_sweep` to confirm padding still fits. Coverage gate stays at 100%. The single heaviest lift. | **L** | Medium — cyclic-recursion padding may shift |
| **P3 — Asset registry endpoints** | `POST /api/asset/create`, `GET /api/asset/list`, `GET /api/asset/info/:id_or_name`. New `assets` table migration. SQL `name UNIQUE` enforcement. Handler tests for the 409-on-conflict race. | **M** | Low — standard HTTP API extension |
| **P4 — Mint signature verification** | `POST /api/mint` switches from faucet to signed creator-mint. Per-asset `num_pubkeys` counter. The faucet shortcut is removed; the always-on `Capabilities.faucet` is rewired to `multi_asset`. | **M** | Medium — replaces a known-good code path; tests must cover the per-asset replay protection |
| **P5 — Send + balance + commit shape** | `POST /api/send` extends signed message, `GET /api/balance` becomes per-asset map, single-asset off-circuit pre-check enforces M5, `Capabilities.multi_asset = true`. Backfill the `MULTI_ASSET_FIXME` sites from P1. | **L** | Medium — multiple coupled changes, all wallet-visible |
| **P6 — Wallet adaptation** | `zk-coins/app`: balance display, send-flow asset picker, create-asset UX. Separate PR(s) in the app repo, gated on `Capabilities.multi_asset` from the node's `/api/info`. | **L** | Medium — UX-heavy, parallel to node work |

**Aggregate effort: M + L + M + M + L + L ≈ 4 person-months at
full focus.** Phase 1 can begin immediately; Phase 2 is the heavy
lift and gates Phases 3 onward.

Per [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) invariant 4, every
phase ships with 100% test coverage on the activated surface
(`cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 100 -- --test-threads=1` from
inside the affected crate). Negative tests — proof rejection when
in-coin `asset_id` differs from out-coin `asset_id`, signature
verification failure on a forged mint, 409 on duplicate name — are
mandatory.

---

## 14. Non-Goals (Restated)

So nobody scope-creeps:

- Migrating existing single-asset state — **not in v1** (closed
  test environment, state-wipe at cutover per invariant 2).
- Per-asset privacy pools — **deferred** (§12.10, decision M4).
- Cross-asset atomic swaps inside zkCoins — **out of protocol**
  (decision M5, §12.9; lives in the BitVM bridge / Lightning
  swap docs).
- Rich on-chain metadata (logo, URI, description) — **excluded**
  (decision M6, §12.8).
- Mint-authority key rotation — **deferred** (§11, §12.7).
- Burn / deflationary mechanics — **not in MVP** (§12.12).
- In-circuit BIP-340 Schnorr verify for the mint branch —
  **open architectural call** (§5.3, §12.6).
- Homograph-attack defence beyond `to_lowercase()` normalisation —
  **open architectural call** (§10, §12.4).
